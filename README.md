# STUDION

**STUDION** is a *fantasy brand* elaborated by **Imagine School** for teaching purposes, as part of their front end engineer course.

The original code was developed by **Bruce Cantarim**. You may find his original STUDION repository in: <https://github.com/brucecantarim/studion/>

My STUDION repository was created *only as an exercise* to help me fixate all the content that was taught me in the course.
